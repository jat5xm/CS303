Part 1
Code is pretty self-explanatory, most of the simple functions were taken and modified from code given from slides from lecture and older classes. A lot of stack overflow and geeksforgeeks links were used as well. I realized I never
seperated the code into proper header and .cpp files and left the function definitions in the header file. I just ended up using the .cpp file as the main where the program could be executed. Numbers can be changed/replaced to whatever
and output should be correct.

Part 2
I ended up going back to a coding assignment from 201 where we had similar assignment that we worked through as a class. Again, stack overflow was really helpful for whenever I was stuck. To execute, use part2main.cpp and simply
change the functions' arguments to whatever you want and the functions should still properly execute.



Not sure how to add images to the read me file, but the outputs should be working.
