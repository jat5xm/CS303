# CS303 - Assignment 1
Honestly, I feel like a struggled a lot with this first assignment despite it being fairly simple. My coding skills aren't that great but I tried to complete as much as I could. I struggled a lot with completing the modifying an 
index function (step 2 on Q1) and had troubles properly implementing the code for the function that replaces/removes the index. Some fairly easy tasks but I still couldn't properly finish them. The code in main is overall pretty bare,
I know certain parts of the code such as opening the file and searching for a certain index in the data of the array were able to work properly. The steps were laid out in main and comments were added but like I said, my work was a bit rough and lacking.
